"""
The testing system will find tests in any file whose name begins with `test`

Rules of thumb for testing:
- Have a separate test class for each model and view
- Have a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test
- Test method names should describe their function

We can run these tests automatically from the CLI using:
python manage.py test (<app-name>|<app-name.TestCase>|<app-name.TestCase.method_name>)
Note: passing the flag --pdb will launch the debugger on â€ est failure

Or we can run them from a shell using:
$ python manage.py shell
>>> from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment
>>> # install a template renderer to examine attributes (like response.context)
>>> # that otherwise wouldn't be available; note this DOESN'T create a test db.
>>> setup_test_environment()
>>> from django.test import Client
>>> use the test client to test endpoints and inspect responses
>>> client = Client()

Note: in database tests, the database is cleared in each method.
Objects created in one method will not carry over to others.
